# Titanic_datasets-email_classification

# *Overview*
This repository contains two python notebooks utilizing the machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes algorithms).
* *Dataset 1*: Titanic Dataset Train:https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv and Test:https://archive.org/download/test1_202002/test%20%281%29.csv
* *Dataset 2*: Spambase Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
Using the algorithms specified above, we try to predict the likelihood of occurence of the target variable {survived : spam}
